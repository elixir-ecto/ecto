defmodule Ecto.Adapters.Worker do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a worker to be used by adapters.

  The worker is responsible for managing the connection to
  the database, automatically starting a new one if it crashes.
  The `ask/2` and `ask!/2` functions can be used any time to
  retrieve the connection and its module.

  The worker also adds support for laziness, allowing developers
  to create workers but connect to the database only when needed
  for the first time. Finally, the worker also provides transaction
  semantics, with open/close commands as well as a sandbox mode.

  In order to use a worker, adapter developers need to implement
  two callbacks in a module, `connect/1` and `disconnect/1` defined
  in this module. The worker is started by passing the module that
  implements the callbacks and as well as the connection arguments.

  ## Transaction modes

  The worker supports transactions. The idea is that, once a
  transaction is open, the worker is going to monitor the client
  and disconnect if the client crashes without properly closing
  the connection.

  Most of the transaction functions are about telling the worker
  how to react on crashes, the client is still responsible for
  keeping the transaction state.

  The worker also supports a sandbox transaction, which means
  transaction management is done on the client and opening a
  transaction is then disabled.

  Finally, operations like `break_transaction/2` can be used
  when something goes wrong, ensuring a disconnection happens.

  Opens a transaction.

  Invoked when the client wants to open up a connection.

  The worker process starts to monitor the caller and
  will wipeout all connection state in case of crashes.

  It returns an `:ok` tuple if the transaction can be
  opened, a `:sandbox` tuple in case the transaction
  could not be openned because it is in sandbox mode
  or an `:error` tuple, usually when the adapter is
  unable to connect.

  ## FAQ

  Question: What happens if `open_transaction/2` is
  called when a transaction is already open?

  Answer: If a transaction is already open, the previous
  transaction along side its connection will be discarded
  and a new one will be started transparently. The reasoning
  is that if the client is calling `open_transaction/2` when
  one is already open, is because the client lost its state,
  and we should treat it transparently by disconnecting the
  old state and starting a new one.
