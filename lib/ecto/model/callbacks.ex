defmodule Ecto.Model.Callbacks do
  @moduledoc """
  Define module-level callbacks in models.

  ## Lifecycle callbacks

  Ecto provides lifecycle callbacks around insert, update
  and delete commands.

  A callback is invoked by your `Ecto.Repo` before (or after)
  particular events. Lifecycle callbacks always receive a
  changeset as an argument and must always return a modified changeset.

  Such callbacks are useful for data consistency: keeping
  counters, setting field values and so on. For this reason,
  callbacks:

    * cannot abort
    * always run inside the transaction
    * are invoked only after the data is validated

  Therefore, don't use callbacks for validation, enforcing business
  rules or performing actions unrelated to the data itself, like
  sending e-mails.

  Finally keep in mind callbacks are not invoked on bulk actions
  such as `Ecto.Repo.update_all/3` or `Ecto.Repo.delete_all/2`.

  ## Other callbacks

  Besides lifecycle callbacks, Ecto also supports an `after_load`
  callback that is invoked everytime a model is loaded with the
  model itself. See `after_load/2` for more informations.

  ## Examples

      defmodule User do
        use Ecto.Model.Callbacks

        after_insert :increase_user_count

        def increase_user_count(changeset) do
          # ...
        end
      end

  When creating the user, the `after_insert` callbacks will be
  invoked with a changeset as argument. Multiple callbacks
  can be defined, they will be invoked in order of declaration.

  A callback can be defined in the following formats:

      # Invoke the local function increase_user_count/1
      after_insert :increase_user_count

      # Invoke the local function increase_user_count/3
      # with the given arguments (changeset is prepended)
      after_insert :increase_user_count, ["foo", "bar"]

      # Invoke the remote function Stats.increase_user_count/1
      after_insert Stats, :increase_user_count

      # Invoke the remote function Stats.increase_user_count/3
      # with the given arguments (changeset is prepended)
      after_insert Stats, :increase_user_count, ["foo", "bar"]

  # Callback macros

  @doc """
  Adds a callback that is invoked before the model is inserted
  into the repository.

  Since on insert all the model fields plus changeset changes
  are sent to the repository, the callback receives an
  `Ecto.Changeset` with all the model fields and changes in
  the `changeset.changes` field. At this point, the changeset
  has already been validated and is always valid.

  The callback must return a changeset and always runs inside
  a transaction.

      before_insert User, :generate_permalink

  Adds a callback that is invoked after the model is loaded
  from the repository.

  The callback receives the model being loaded and must
  return a model.

  This callback can be useful to resolve the value of virtual
  fields in situations they must always be present in the model.
  Since this will be invoked every time the model is loaded, the
  callback must execute very quickly to avoid drastic perfomance
  hits.
  
  Another common misuse of `after_load` callbacks is to use it
  for loading fields which are not always required. For example,
  imagine you need to generate an access token based on the `User`
  id and password. One could use `after_load` and a virtual field
  to precompute the `access_token` value but it is simpler and cleaner
  to simply provide an `access_token` function in the model:

      User.access_token(user)
