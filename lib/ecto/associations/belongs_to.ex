  Any association module will generate the `__assoc__` function that can be

  * `__assoc__(:loaded, assoc)` - Returns the loaded entities or `:not_loaded`;
  * `__assoc__(:loaded, value, assoc)` - Sets the loaded entities;
  * `__assoc__(:target, assoc)` - Returns the entity where the association was
