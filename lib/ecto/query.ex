defmodule Ecto.Query do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides the Query DSL.

  Queries are used to retrieve and manipualte data in a repository
  (see `Ecto.Repo`). Although this module provides a complete API,
  supporting expressions like `where/3`, `select/3` and so forth,
  most of the times developers need to import only the `from/2`
  macro.

      # Imports only from/1 and from/2 from Ecto.Query
      import Ecto.Query, only: [from: 2]

      # Create a query
      query = from w in Weather,
            where: w.prcp > 0,
           select: w.city

      # econd the query to the repository
      Repo.all(query)

  ## Composition

  Ecto queries are composable. For example, the query above can
  actually be defined in two parts:

      # Create a query
      query = from w in Weather, where: w.prcp > 0,

      # Extend the query
      query = from w in query, select: w.city

  Keep in mind though the variable names used on the left-hand
  side of `in` are just a convenience, they are not taken into
  account in the query generation.

  Any value can used on the right-side of `in` as long as it
  implements the `Ecto.Queryable` protocol.

  ## Data security

  External values and elixir expressions can be injected into a query
  expression with `^`. Anything that isn't inside a `^` expression
  is treated as a query expression.

  This allows one to create dynamic queries:

      def with_minimum(age, height_ft) do
          from u in User,
        where: u.age > ^age and u.height > ^(height_ft * 3.28)
      end

  In the example above, we will compare against the `age` and `height`
  given as arguments, appropriately convering the height. Note all
  external values will be quoted to avoid SQL injection attacks in
  the underlying repository.

  Notice the `select` clause is optional, Ecto will automatically infers
  and returns the user record (similar to `select: u`) from the query above.

  ## Type safety

  Ecto queries are also type-safe. For example, the following query:

      from u in User, where: u.age == "zero"

  will error with the following message:

      ** (Ecto.Query.TypeCheckError) the following expression does not type check:

          &0.age() == "zero"

      Allowed types for ==/2:

          number == number
          var == var
          nil == _
          _ == nil

      Got: integer == string

  The types above mean:

  * `number == number` - any number (be it float, integer, etc) can be compared
    with any other number;
  * `var == var` - the comparison operator also works if both operands are of
    the same type (i.e. `var` represents a variable type);
  * `nil == _` and `_ == nil` - the comparison operator also type checks if any
    of the operands are nil;

  All operations allowed in a query with their respective type are defined
  in `Ecto.Query.API`.

  ## Query expansion

  In all examples so far, we have used the **keywords query syntax** to create
  a query. Our first example:

      import Ecto.Query

         from w in Weather,
       where: w.prcp > 0,
      select: w.city

  Simply expands to the following **query expressions**:

      from(w in Weather) |> where([w], w.prcp > 0) |> select([w], w.city)

  Which then expands to:

      select(where(from(w in Weather), [w], w.prcp > 0), [w], w.city)

  This module documents each of those macros, providing examples both
  in the keywords query and in the query expression formats.

  Creates a query.

  It can either be a keyword query or a query expression. If it is a
  keyword query the first argument should be an `in` expression and
  the second argument a keyword query where they keys are expression
  types and the values are expressions.

  If it is a query expression the first argument is the original query
  and the second argument the expression.

  ## Keywords examples

      from(City, select: c)

  ## Expressions examples

      from(City) |> select([c], c)

  ## Examples

      def paginate(query, page, size) do
        from query,
          limit: size,
          offset: (page-1) * size
      end

  The example above does not use `in` because none of `limit` and `offset`
  requires such. However, extending a query with where expression would
  require so:

      def published(query) do
        from p in query, where: p.published_at != nil
      end

  Notice we have created a `p` variable to represent each item in the query.
  In case the given query has more than one `from` expression, each of them
  must be given in the order they were bound:

      def published_multi(query) do
        from [p,o] in query,
        where: p.published_at != nil and o.published_at != nil
      end

  Note the variables `p` and `q` must be named as you find more convenient
  as they have no important in the query sent to the database.

  A join query expression.

  Receives an entity that is to be joined to the query and a condition to
  do the joining on. The join condition can be any expression that evaluates
  to a boolean value. The join is by default an inner join, the qualifier
  can be changed by giving the atoms: `:inner`, `:left`, `:right` or
  `:full`. For a keyword query the `:join` keyword can be changed to:
  `:inner_join`, `:left_join`, `:right_join` or `:full_join`.

  The join condition can be automatically set when doing an association
  join. An association join can be done on any association field
  (`has_many`, `has_one`, `belong_to`).

  A select query expression.

  Selects which fields will be selected from the entity and any transformations
  that should be performed on the fields. Any expression that is accepted in a
  query can be a select field.

  There can only be one select expression in a query, if the select expression
  is omitted, the query will by default select the full entity.

  The sub-expressions in the query can be wrapped in lists or tuples as shown in
  the examples. A full entity can also be selected.

  The `assoc/2` selector can be used to embed an association on a parent entity
  as shown in the examples below. The first argument to `assoc` has to be a
  variable bound in the `from` query expression, the second has to be the field
  of the association and a variable bound in an association join.

  Nested `assoc/2 expressions are also allowed when there are multiple
  association joins in the query.

  A distinct query expression.

  Only keep one row for each combination of values in the `distinct` query
  expression.

  The row that is being kept depends on the ordering of the rows. To ensure
  results are consistents, if an `order_by` expression is also added to the
  query, its leftmost part must first reference all the fields in the
  `distinct` expression before referencing another field.

  referenced in the `group_by` can be used in the `select` or if the field
  is given as an argument to an aggregate function.

  Mark associations to be pre-loaded.

  Pre-loading allow developers to specify associations that should be pre-
  loaded once the first result set is retrieved. Consider this example:

      Repo.all from p in Post, preload: [:comments]

  The example above will fetch all posts from the database and then do
  a separate query returning all comments associated to the given posts.
