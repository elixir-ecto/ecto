defmodule Ecto.Query do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Provides the Query DSL.

  Queries are used to retrieve and manipulate data from a repository
  (see `Ecto.Repo`). Ecto queries come in two flavors: keyword-based
  and macro-based. Most examples will use the keyword-based syntax,
  the macro one will be explored in later sections.

  Let's see a sample query:

      # Imports only from/2 of Ecto.Query
      import Ecto.Query, only: [from: 2]

      # Create a query
      query = from u in "users",
                where: u.age > 18,
                select: u.name

      # Send the query to the repository
      Repo.all(query)

  In the example above, we are directly querying the "users" table
  from the database.

  ## Query expressions

  Ecto allows a limited set of expressions inside queries. In the
  query below, for example, we use `u.age` to access a field, the
  `>` comparison operator and the literal `0`:

      query = from u in "users", where: u.age > 0, select: u.name

  You can find the full list of operations in `Ecto.Query.API`.
  Besides the operations listed there, the following literals are
  supported in queries:

    * Integers: `1`, `2`, `3`
    * Floats: `1.0`, `2.0`, `3.0`
    * Booleans: `true`, `false`
    * Binaries: `<<1, 2, 3>>`
    * Strings: `"foo bar"`, `~s(this is a string)`
    * Arrays: `[1, 2, 3]`, `~w(interpolate words)`

  All other types and dynamic values must be passed as a parameter using
  interpolation as explained below.

  ## Interpolation and casting

  External values and Elixir expressions can be injected into a query
  expression with `^`:

      def with_minimum(age, height_ft) do
        from u in "users",
          where: u.age > ^age and u.height > ^(height_ft * 3.28),
          select: u.name
      end

      with_minimum(18, 5.0)

  When interpolating values, you may want to explicitly tell Ecto
  what is the expected type of the value being interpolated:

      age = "18"
      Repo.all(from u in "users",
                where: u.age > type(^age, :integer),
                select: u.name)

  In the example above, Ecto will cast the age to type integer. When
  a value cannot be cast, `Ecto.Query.CastError` is raised.

  To avoid the repetition of always specifying the types, you may define
  an `Ecto.Schema`. In such cases, Ecto will analyze your queries and
  automatically cast the interpolated "age" when compared to the `u.age`
  field, as long as the age field is defined with type `:integer` in
  your schema:

      age = "18"
      Repo.all(from u in User, where: u.age > ^age, select: u.name)

  Another advantage of using schemas is that we no longer need to specify
  the select option in queries, as by default Ecto will retrieve all
  fields specified in the schema:

      age = "18"
      Repo.all(from u in User, where: u.age > ^age)

  For this reason, we will use schemas on the remaining examples but
  remember Ecto does not require them in order to write queries.

  ## `nil` comparison

  `nil` comparison in filters, such as where and having, is forbidden
  and it will raise an error:

      # Raises if age is nil
      from u in User, where: u.age == ^age

  This is done as a security measure to avoid attacks that attempt
  to traverse entries with nil columns. To check that value is `nil`,
  use `is_nil/1` instead:

      from u in User, where: is_nil(u.age)

  ## Composition

  Ecto queries are composable. For example, the query above can
  actually be defined in two parts:

      # Create a query
      query = from u in User, where: u.age > 18

      # Extend the query
      query = from u in query, select: u.name

  Composing queries uses the same syntax as creating a query.
  The difference is that, instead of passing a schema like `User`
  on the right side of `in`, we passed the query itself.

  Any value can be used on the right-side of `in` as long as it implements
  the `Ecto.Queryable` protocol. For now, we know the protocol is
  implemented for both atoms (like `User`) and strings (like "users").

  In any case, regardless if a schema has been given or not, Ecto
  queries are always composable thanks to its binding system.

  ### Positional bindings

  On the left side of `in` we specify the query bindings.  This is
  done inside from and join clauses.  In the query below `u` is a
  binding and `u.age` is a field access using this binding.

      query = from u in User, where: u.age > 18

  Bindings are not exposed from the query.  When composing queries, you
  must specify bindings again for each refinement query.  For example,
  to further narrow down the above query, we again need to tell Ecto what
  bindings to expect:

      query = from u in query, select: u.city

  Bindings in Ecto are positional, and the names do not have to be
  consistent between input and refinement queries. For example, the
  query above could also be written as:

      query = from q in query, select: q.city

  It would make no difference to Ecto. This is important because
  it allows developers to compose queries without caring about
  the bindings used in the initial query.

  When using joins, the bindings should be matched in the order they
  are specified:

      # Create a query
      query = from p in Post,
                join: c in Comment, where: c.post_id == p.id

      # Extend the query
      query = from [p, c] in query,
                select: {p.title, c.body}

  You are not required to specify all bindings when composing.
  For example, if we would like to order the results above by
  post insertion date, we could further extend it as:

      query = from q in query, order_by: q.inserted_at

  The example above will work if the input query has 1 or 10
  bindings. As long as the number of bindings is less than the
  number of from + joins, Ecto will match only what you have
  specified. The first binding always matches the source given
  in `from`.

  Similarly, if you are interested only on the last binding
  (or the last bindings) in a query, you can use `...` to
  specify "all bindings before" and match on the last one.

  For instance, imagine you wrote:

      posts_with_comments =
        from p in query, join: c in Comment, where: c.post_id == p.id

  And now we want to make sure to return both the post title
  and the comment body. Although we may not know how many
  bindings there are in the query, we are sure posts is the
  first binding and comments are the last one, so we can write:

      from [p, ..., c] in posts_with_comments, select: {p.title, c.body}

  In other words, `...` will include all the binding between the
  first and the last, which may be no binding at all, one or many.

  ### Named bindings

  Another option for flexibly building queries with joins are
  named bindings. Coming back to the previous example, provided
  we bind a join to a concrete name:

      posts_with_comments =
        from p in query,
          join: c in Comment, as: :comment, where: c.post_id == p.id

  We can refer to it by that name using a following form of
  bindings list:

      from [p, comment: c] in posts_with_comments, select: {p.title, c.body}

  This approach lets us not worry about keeping track of the position
  of the bindings when composing the query.

  What's more, a name can be assigned to the first binding as well:

      from p in Post, as: :post

  Only atoms are accepted for binding names. Named binding references
  are expected to be placed in the tail position of the bindings list.

  ### Bindingless operations

  Although bindings are extremely useful when working with joins,
  they are not necessary when the query has only the `from` clause.
  For such cases, Ecto supports a way for building queries
  without specifying the binding:

      from Post,
        where: [category: "fresh and new"],
        order_by: [desc: :published_at],
        select: [:id, :title, :body]

  The query above will select all posts with category "fresh and new",
  order by the most recently published, and return Post structs with
  only the id, title and body fields set. It is equivalent to:

      from p in Post,
        where: p.category == "fresh and new",
        order_by: [desc: p.published_at],
        select: struct(p, [:id, :title, :body])

  One advantage of bindingless queries is that they are data-driven
  and therefore useful for dynamically building queries. For example,
  the query above could also be written as:

      where = [category: "fresh and new"]
      order_by = [desc: :published_at]
      select = [:id, :title, :body]
      from Post, where: ^where, order_by: ^order_by, select: ^select

  This feature is very useful when queries need to be built based
  on some user input, like web search forms, CLIs and so on.

  ## Fragments

  If you need an escape hatch, Ecto provides fragments
  (see `Ecto.Query.API.fragment/1`) to inject SQL (and non-SQL)
  fragments into queries.

  For example, to get all posts while running the "lower(?)"
  function in the database where `p.title` is interpolated
  in place of `?`, one can write:

      from p in Post,
        where: is_nil(p.published_at) and
               fragment("lower(?)", p.title) == ^title

  Also, most adapters provide direct APIs for queries, like
  `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.query/4`, allowing developers to
  completely bypass Ecto queries.

  ## Macro API

  In all examples so far we have used the **keywords query syntax** to
  create a query:

      import Ecto.Query
      from u in "users", where: u.age > 18, select: u.name

  Due to the prevalence of the pipe operator in Elixir, Ecto also supports
  a pipe-based syntax:

      "users"
      |> where([u], u.age > 18)
      |> select([u], u.name)

  The keyword-based and pipe-based examples are equivalent. The downside
  of using macros is that the binding must be specified for every operation.
  However, since keyword-based and pipe-based examples are equivalent, the
  bindingless syntax also works for macros:

      "users"
      |> where([u], u.age > 18)
      |> select([:name])

  Such allows developers to write queries using bindings only in more
  complex query expressions.

  This module documents each of those macros, providing examples in
  both the keywords query and pipe expression formats.

  ## Query Prefix

  It is possible to set a prefix for the queries. For Postgres users,
  this will specify the schema where the table is located, while for
  MySQL users this will specify the database where the table is
  located.  When no prefix is set, Postgres queries are assumed to be
  in the public schema, while MySQL queries are assumed to be in the
  database set in the config for the repo.

  The query prefix may be set either for the whole query or on each
  individual `from` and `join` expression. If a `prefix` is not given
  to a `from` or a `join`, the prefix of the schema given to the `from`
  or `join` is used. The query prefix is used only if none of the above
  are declared.

  Let's see some examples. To see the query prefix globally, the simplest
  mechanism is to pass an option to the repository operation:

      results = Repo.all(query, prefix: "accounts")

  You may also set the prefix for the whole query by setting the prefix field:

      results =
        query # May be User or an Ecto.Query itself
        |> Ecto.Queryable.to_query
        |> Map.put(:prefix, "accounts")
        |> Repo.all()

  Setting the prefix in the query changes the default prefix of all `from`
  and `join` expressions. You can override the query prefix by either setting
  the `@schema_prefix` in your schema definitions or by passing the prefix
  option:

      from u in User,
        prefix: "accounts",
        join: p in assoc(u, :posts),
        prefix: "public"

  Overall, here is the prefix lookup precedence:

    1. The `:prefix` option given to `from`/`join` has the highest precedence
    2. Then it falls back to the `@schema_prefix` attribute declared in the schema
      given to `from`/`join`
    3. Then it falls back to the query prefix

  The prefixes set in the query will be preserved when loading data.

  Builds a dynamic query expression.

  Dynamic query expressions allows developers to build queries
  expression bit by bit so they are later interpolated in a query.

  ## Examples

  For example, imagine you have a set of conditions you want to
  build your query on:

      conditions = false

      conditions =
        if params["is_public"] do
          dynamic([p], p.is_public or ^conditions)
        else
          conditions
        end

      conditions =
        if params["allow_reviewers"] do
          dynamic([p, a], a.reviewer == true or ^conditions)
        else
          conditions
        end

      from query, where: ^conditions

  In the example above, we were able to build the query expressions
  bit by bit, using different bindings, and later interpolate it all
  at once inside the query.

  A dynamic expression can always be interpolated inside another dynamic
  expression and into the constructs described below.

  ## `where`, `having` and a `join`'s `on'

  The `dynamic` macro can be interpolated at the root of a `where`,
  `having` or a `join`'s `on`.

  For example, assuming the `conditions` variable defined in the
  previous section, the following is forbidden because it is not
  at the root of a `where`:

      from q in query, where: q.some_condition and ^conditions

  Fortunately that's easily solvable by simply rewriting it to:

      conditions = dynamic([q], q.some_condition and ^conditions)
      from query, where: ^conditions

  ## Updates

  Dynamic is also supported as each field in an update, for example:

      update_to = dynamic([p], p.sum / p.count)
      from query, update: [set: [average: ^update_to]]

  Defines windows which can be used with `Ecto.Query.WindowAPI`.

  Receives a keyword list where keys are names of the windows
  and values are a keyword list with window expressions.

  ## Examples

      # Compare each employee's salary with the average salary in his or her department
      from e in Employee,
        select: {e.depname, e.empno, e.salary, over(avg(e.salary), :department)},
        windows: [department: [partition_by: e.depname]]

  In the example above, we get the average salary per department.
  `:department` is the window name, partitioned by `e.depname`
  and `avg/1` is the window function. For more information
  on windows functions, see `Ecto.Query.WindowAPI`.

  ## Window expressions

  The following keys are allowed when specifying a window.

  ### :partition_by

  A list of fields to partition the window by, for example:

      windows: [department: [partition_by: e.depname]]

  A list of atoms can also be interpolated for dynamic partitioning:

      fields = [:depname, :year]
      windows: [dynamic_window: [partition_by: ^fields]]

  ### :order_by

  A list of fields to order the window by, for example:

      windows: [ordered_names: [order_by: e.name]]

  It works exactly as the keyword query version of `order_by/3`.

  ### :frame

  A fragment which defines the frame for window functions.

  ## Examples

      # compare each employee's salary for each month with his average salary for previous 3 months
      from p in Payroll,
        select: {p.empno, p.date, p.salary, over(avg(p.salary), :prev_months)},

  Converts a query into a subquery.

  If a subquery is given, returns the subquery itself.
  If any other value is given, it is converted to a query via
  `Ecto.Queryable` and wrapped in the `Ecto.SubQuery` struct.

  Subqueries are currently only supported in the `from`
  and `join` fields.

  ## Examples

      # Get the average salary of the top 10 highest salaries
      query = from Employee, order_by: [desc: :salary], limit: 10
      from e in subquery(query), select: avg(e.salary)

  A prefix can be specified for a subquery, similar to standard repo operations:

      query = from Employee, order_by: [desc: :salary], limit: 10
      from e in subquery(query, prefix: "my_prefix"), select: avg(e.salary)

  Although subqueries are not allowed in WHERE expressions,
  most subqueries in WHERE expression can be rewritten as JOINs.
  Imagine you want to write this query:

      UPDATE posts
        SET sync_started_at = $1
        WHERE id IN (
          SELECT id FROM posts
            WHERE synced = false AND (sync_started_at IS NULL OR sync_started_at < $1)
            LIMIT $2
        )

  If you attempt to write it as `where: p.id in ^subquery(foo)`,
  Ecto won't accept such query. However, the subquery above can be
  written as a JOIN, which is supported by Ecto. The final Ecto
  query will look like this:

      subset_query = from(p in Post,
        where: p.synced == false and
                 (is_nil(p.sync_started_at) or p.sync_started_at < ^min_sync_started_at),
        limit: ^batch_size
      )

        from(p in Post, join: s in subquery(subset_query), on: s.id == p.id),

  Creates a query.

  It can either be a keyword query or a query expression.

  If it is a keyword query the first argument must be
  either an `in` expression, or a value that implements
  the `Ecto.Queryable` protocol. If the query needs a
  reference to the data source in any other part of the
  expression, then an `in` must be used to create a reference
  variable. The second argument should be a keyword query

  expressions.

  do not require a reference to the data source. However, extending
  the query with a where expression would require the use of `in`:

      def published(query) do
        from p in query, where: not(is_nil(p.published_at))
      end

  Notice we have created a `p` variable to reference the query's
  original data source. This assumes that the original query
  only had one source. When the given query has more than one source,
  positonal or named bindings may be used to access the additional sources.

      def published_multi(query) do
        from [p,o] in query,
        where: not(is_nil(p.published_at)) and not(is_nil(o.published_at))
      end

  Note the variables `p` and `o` can be named whatever you like
  as they have no importance in the query sent to the database.

  A join query expression.

  Receives a source that is to be joined to the query and a condition for
  the join. The join condition can be any expression that evaluates
  to a boolean value. The join is by default an inner join, the qualifier
  can be changed by giving the atoms: `:inner`, `:left`, `:right`, `:cross`,
  `:full`, `:inner_lateral` or `:left_lateral`. For a keyword query the `:join`
  keyword can be changed to: `:inner_join`, `:left_join`, `:right_join`,
  `:cross_join`, `:full_join`, `:inner_lateral_join` or `:left_lateral_join`.

  Currently it is possible to join on:

    * an `Ecto.Schema`, such as `p in Post`
    * an interpolated Ecto query with zero or more where clauses,
      such as `c in ^(from "posts", where: [public: true])`
    * an association, such as `c in assoc(post, :comments)`
    * a subquery, such as `c in subquery(another_query)`
    * a query fragment, such as `c in fragment("SOME COMPLEX QUERY")`,
      see "Joining with fragments" below.

  ## Options

  Each join accepts the following options:

    * `:on` - a query expression or keyword list to filter the join
    * `:as` - a named binding for the join
    * `:prefix` - the prefix to be used for the join when issuing a database query
    * `:hints` - a string or a list of strings to be used as database hints

  In the keyword query syntax, those options must be given immediately
  after the join. In the expression syntax, the options are given as
  the fifth argument.

  ## Keywords examples

      from c in Comment,
        join: p in Post,
        on: p.id == c.post_id,
        select: {p.title, c.text}

      from p in Post,
        left_join: c in assoc(p, :comments),
        select: {p, c}

  Keywords can also be given or interpolated as part of `on`:

      from c in Comment,
        join: p in Post,
        on: [id: c.post_id],
        select: {p.title, c.text}

  Any key in `on` will apply to the currently joined expression.

  It is also possible to interpolate an Ecto query on the right side
  of `in`. For example, the query above can also be written as:

      posts = Post
      from c in Comment,
        join: p in ^posts,
        on: [id: c.post_id],
        select: {p.title, c.text}

  The above is specially useful to dynamically join on existing
  queries, for example, to dynamically choose a source, or by
  choosing between public posts or posts that have been recently
  published:

      posts =
        if params["drafts"] do
          from p in Post, where: [drafts: true]
        else
          from p in Post, where: [public: true]
        end

      from c in Comment,
        join: p in ^posts, on: [id: c.post_id],
        select: {p.title, c.text}

  Only simple queries with `where` expressions can be interpolated
  in join.

  ## Expressions examples

      Comment
      |> join(:inner, [c], p in Post, on: c.post_id == p.id)
      |> select([c, p], {p.title, c.text})

      Post
      |> join(:left, [p], c in assoc(p, :comments))
      |> select([p, c], {p, c})

      Post
      |> join(:left, [p], c in Comment, on: c.post_id == p.id and c.is_visible == true)
      |> select([p, c], {p, c})

  ## Joining with fragments

  When you need to join on a complex query, Ecto supports fragments in joins:

      Comment
      |> join(:inner, [c], p in fragment("SOME COMPLEX QUERY", c.id, ^some_param))

  Although using fragments in joins is discouraged in favor of Ecto
  Query syntax, they are necessary when writing lateral joins as
  lateral joins require a subquery that refer to previous bindings:

      Game
      |> join(:inner_lateral, [g], gs in fragment("SELECT * FROM games_sold AS gs WHERE gs.game_id = ? ORDER BY gs.sold_on LIMIT 2", g.id))
      |> select([g, gs], {g.name, gs.sold_on})

  Note that the `join` does not automatically wrap the fragment in
  parentheses, since some expressions require parens and others
  require no parens. Therefore, in cases such as common table
  expressions, you will have to explicitly wrap the fragment content
  in parens.

  ## Hints

  `from` and `join` also support index hints, as found in databases such as
  [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/index-hints.html) and
  [MSSQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-table?view=sql-server-2017).

  For example, a developer using MySQL may write:

      from p in Post,
        join: c in Comment,
        hints: ["USE INDEX FOO", "USE INDEX BAR"],
        where: p.id == c.post_id,
        select: c

  Keep in mind you want to use hints rarely, so don't forget to read the database
  disclaimers about such functionality.

  A select query expression.

  Selects which fields will be selected from the schema and any transformations
  that should be performed on the fields. Any expression that is accepted in a
  query can be a select field.

  Select also allows each expression to be wrapped in lists, tuples or maps as
  shown in the examples below. A full schema can also be selected.

  There can only be one select expression in a query, if the select expression
  is omitted, the query will by default select the full schema. If select is
  given more than once, an error is raised. Use `exclude/2` if you would like
  to remove a previous select for overriding or see `select_merge/3` for a
  limited version of `select` that is composable and can be called multiple
  times.

  `select` also accepts a list of atoms where each atom refers to a field in
  the source to be selected.

  ## Keywords examples

      from(c in City, select: c) # returns the schema as a struct
      from(c in City, select: {c.name, c.population})
      from(c in City, select: [c.name, c.county])
      from(c in City, select: %{n: c.name, answer: 42})
      from(c in City, select: %{c | alternative_name: c.name})
      from(c in City, select: %Data{name: c.name})

  It is also possible to select a struct and limit the returned
  fields at the same time:

      from(City, select: [:name])

  The syntax above is equivalent to:

      from(city in City, select: struct(city, [:name]))

  You can also write:

      from(city in City, select: map(city, [:name]))

  If you want a map with only the selected fields to be returned.
  For more information, read the docs for `Ecto.Query.API.struct/2`
  and `Ecto.Query.API.map/2`.

  Mergeable select query expression.

  This macro is similar to `select/3` except it may be specified
  multiple times as long as every entry is a map. This is useful
  for merging and composing selects. For example:

      query = from p in Post, select: %{}

      query =
        if include_title? do
          from p in query, select_merge: %{title: p.title}

          from p in query, select_merge: %{visits: p.visits}
        else
          query
        end

  In the example above, the query is built little by little by merging
  into a final map. If both conditions above are true, the final query
  would be equivalent to:

      from p in Post, select: %{title: p.title, visits: p.visits}

  If `:select_merge` is called and there is no value selected previously,
  it will default to the source, `p` in the example above.

  The argument given to `:select_merge` must always be a map. The value
  being merged on must be a struct or a map. If it is a struct, the fields
  merged later on must be part of the struct, otherwise an error is raised.

  A distinct query expression.

  When true, only keeps distinct values from the resulting
  select expression.

  If supported by your database, you can also pass query expressions
  to distinct and it will generate a query with DISTINCT ON. In such
  cases, `distinct` accepts exactly the same expressions as `order_by`
  and any `distinct` expression will be automatically prepended to the
  `order_by` expressions in case there is any `order_by` expression.

  An AND where query expression.

  `where` expressions are used to filter the result set. If there is more
  than one where expression, they are combined with an `and` operator. All
  where expressions have to evaluate to a boolean value.

  `where` also accepts a keyword list where the field given as key is going to
  be compared with the given value. The fields will always refer to the source
  given in `from`.

  ## Keywords example

      from(c in City, where: c.country == "Sweden")

  It is also possible to interpolate the whole keyword list, allowing you to
  dynamically filter the source:

  An OR where query expression.

  Behaves exactly the same as `where` except it combines with any previous
  expression by using an `OR`. All expressions have to evaluate to a boolean
  value.

  `or_where` also accepts a keyword list where each key is a field to be
  compared with the given value. Each key-value pair will be combined
  using `AND`, exactly as in `where`.

  ## Keywords example

      from(c in City, where: [country: "Sweden"], or_where: [country: "Brazil"])

  If interpolating keyword lists, the keyword list entries are combined
  using ANDs and joined to any existing expression with an OR:

      filters = [country: "USA", name: "New York"]
      from(c in City, where: [country: "Sweden"], or_where: ^filters)

  is equivalent to:

                             (c.country == "USA" and c.name == "New York")

  The behaviour above is by design to keep the changes between `where`
  and `or_where` minimal. Plus, if you have a keyword list and you
  would like each pair to be combined using `or`, it can be easily done
  with `Enum.reduce/3`:

      filters = [country: "USA", is_tax_exempt: true]
      Enum.reduce(filters, City, fn {key, value}, query ->

  An order by query expression.

  Orders the fields based on one or more fields. It accepts a single field
  or a list of fields. The default direction is ascending (`:asc`) and can be
  customized in a keyword list as one of the following:

    * `:asc`
    * `:asc_nulls_last`
    * `:asc_nulls_first`
    * `:desc`
    * `:desc_nulls_last`
    * `:desc_nulls_first`

  The `*_nulls_first` and `*_nulls_last` variants are not supported by all
  databases. While all databases default to ascending order, the choice of
  "nulls first" or "nulls last" is specific to each database implementation.

  `order_by` may be invoked or listed in a query many times. New expressions
  are always appended to the previous ones.

  `order_by` also accepts a list of atoms where each atom refers to a field in
  source or a keyword list where the direction is given as key and the field
  to order as value.

  A group by query expression.

  Groups together rows from the schema that have the same values in the given
  fields. Using `group_by` "groups" the query giving it different semantics
  in the `select` expression. If a query is grouped, only fields that were
  referenced in the `group_by` can be used in the `select` or if the field
  is given as an argument to an aggregate function.

  `group_by` also accepts a list of atoms where each atom refers to
  a field in source. For more complicated queries you can access fields
  directly instead of atoms.

  ## Keywords examples

      # Returns the number of posts in each category
      from(p in Post,
        group_by: p.category,
        select: {p.category, count(p.id)})

  An AND having query expression.

  `group_by` expression.

  Preloads the associations into the result set.

  Imagine you have an schema `Post` with a `has_many :comments`
  association and you execute the following query:

      Repo.all from p in Post, preload: [:comments]

  The example above will fetch all posts from the database and then do
  a separate query returning all comments associated with the given posts.
  The comments are then processed and associated to each returned `post`
  under the `comments` field.

  Often times, you may want posts and comments to be selected and
  filtered in the same query. For such cases, you can explicitly tell
  an existing join to be preloaded into the result set:

      Repo.all from p in Post,
                 join: c in assoc(p, :comments),
                 where: c.published_at > p.updated_at,
                 preload: [comments: c]

  In the example above, instead of issuing a separate query to fetch
  comments, Ecto will fetch posts and comments in a single query and
  then do a separate pass associating each comment to its parent post.
  Therefore, instead of returning `number_of_posts * number_of_comments`
  results, like a `join` would, it returns only posts with the `comments`
  fields properly filled in.

  Nested associations can also be preloaded in both formats:

      Repo.all from p in Post,
                 preload: [comments: :likes]

      Repo.all from p in Post,
                 join: c in assoc(p, :comments),
                 join: l in assoc(c, :likes),
                 where: l.inserted_at > c.updated_at,
                 preload: [comments: {c, likes: l}]

  ## Preload queries

  Preload also allows queries to be given, allowing you to filter or
  customize how the preloads are fetched:

      comments_query = from c in Comment, order_by: c.published_at
      Repo.all from p in Post, preload: [comments: ^comments_query]

  The example above will issue two queries, one for loading posts and
  then another for loading the comments associated with the posts.
  Comments will be ordered by `published_at`.

  Note: keep in mind operations like limit and offset in the preload
  query will affect the whole result set and not each association. For
  example, the query below:

      comments_query = from c in Comment, order_by: c.popularity, limit: 5
      Repo.all from p in Post, preload: [comments: ^comments_query]

  won't bring the top of comments per post. Rather, it will only bring
  the 5 top comments across all posts.

  ## Preload functions

  Preload also allows functions to be given. In such cases, the function
  receives the IDs of the parent association and it must return the associated
  data. Ecto then will map this data and sort it by the relationship key:

      comment_preloader = fn post_ids -> fetch_comments_by_post_ids(post_ids) end
      Repo.all from p in Post, preload: [comments: ^comment_preloader]

  This is useful when the whole dataset was already loaded or must be
  explicitly fetched from elsewhere. The IDs received by the preloading
  function and the result returned depends on the association type:

    * For `has_many` and `belongs_to` - the function receives the IDs of
      the parent association and it must return a list of maps or structs
      with the associated entries. The associated map/struct must contain
      the "foreign_key" field. For example, if a post has many comments,
      when preloading the comments with a custom function, the function
      will receive a list of "post_ids" as argument and it must return
      maps or structs representing the comments. The maps/structs must
      include the `:post_id` field

    * For `has_many :through` - it behaves similarly to a regular `has_many`
      but note that the IDs received are the ones from the closest
      parent and not the furthest one. Imagine for example a post has
      many comments and each comment has an author. Therefore, a post
      may have many comments_authors, written as
      `has_many :comments_authors, through: [:comments, :author]`. When
      preloading authors with a custom function via `:comments_authors`,
      the function will receive the IDs of the comments and not of the
      posts. That's because through associations are still loaded step
      by step

    * For `many_to_many` -  the function receives the IDs of the parent
      association and it must return a tuple with the parent id as first
      element and the association map or struct as second. For example,
      if a post has many tags, when preloading the tags with a custom
      function, the function will receive a list of "post_ids" as argument
      and it must return a tuple in the format of `{post_id, tag}`
