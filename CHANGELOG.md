# Changelog for v3.0

## Highlights

This is a new major release for Ecto v3.0. Despite the major number, this is a small release with the main goal of removing the previously deprecated Ecto datetime types in favor of the Calendar types that ship as part of Elixir and updating to the latest JSON handling best practices.

### Calendar types

`Ecto.Date`, `Ecto.Time` and `Ecto.DateTime` no longer exist. Instead developers should use `Date`, `Time`, `DateTime` and `NaiveDateTime` that ship as part of Elixir and are the preferred types since Ecto 2.1. Database adapters have also been standarized to work with Elixir types and they no longer return tuples when developers perform raw queries.

To uniformly support microseconds across all databases, the types `:time`, `:naive_datetime`, `:utc_datetime` will now discard any microseconds information. Ecto v3.0 introduces the types `:time_usec`, `:naive_datetime_usec` and `:utc_datetime_usec` as an alternative for those interested in keeping microseconds. If you want to keep microseconds in your migrations and schemas, you need to configure your repository:

    config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
      migration_timestamps: [type: :naive_datetime_usec]

And then in your schema:

    @timestamps_opts [type: :naive_datetime_usec]

### JSON handling

Ecto v3.0 moved the management of the JSON library to adapters. All adapters should default to [`Jason`](https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason).

The following configuration will emit a warning:

    config :ecto, :json_library, CustomJSONLib

And should be rewritten as:

    # For Postgres
    config :postgrex, :json_library, CustomJSONLib

    # For MySQL
    config :mariaex, :json_library, CustomJSONLib

If you want to rollback to Poison, you need to configure your adapter accordingly:

    # For Postgres
    config :postgrex, :json_library, Poison

    # For MySQL
    config :mariaex, :json_library, Poison

We recommend everyone to migrate to Jason. Built-in support for Poison will be removed in future Ecto 3.x releases.

## v3.0.0-dev (In Progress)

### Enhancements

  * [Ecto.Changeset] Put constraint name in error metadata for constraints
  * [Ecto.Migration] Migrations now lock the migrations table in order to avoid concurrent migrations in a cluster. The type of lock can be configured via the `:migration_lock` repository configuration and defaults to "FOR UPDATE" or disabled if set to nil
  * [Ecto.Migration] Add `migration_default_prefix`
  * [Ecto.Query] Add `unsafe_fragment` to queries which allow developers to send dynamically generated fragments to the database that are not checked (and therefore unsafe)
  * [Ecto.Query] Support tuples in filter expressions, allowing queries such as `where: {p.foo, p.bar} > {^foo, ^bar}`
  * [Ecto.Query] Support excluding specific join types in `exclude/2`
  * [Ecto.Repo] Support `:replace_all_except_primary_key` as `:on_conflict` strategy
  * [Ecto.Repo] Support `{:replace, fields}` as `:on_conflict` strategy
  * [Ecto.Repo] Support `select` in queries given to `update_all` and `delete_all`

### Bug fixes

  * [Ecto.Migration] Keep double underscores on autogenerated index names to be consistent with changesets
  * [mix ecto.migrations] List migrated versions even if the migration file is deleted

### Deprecations

  * [Ecto.Changeset] Passing a list of binaries to `cast/3` is deprecated, please pass a list of atoms instead
  * [Ecto.Multi] `Ecto.Multi.run/3` now receives the repo in which the transaction is executing as the first argument to functions, and the changes so far as the second argument
  * [Ecto.Repo] The `:returning` option for `update_all` and `delete_all` has been deprecated as those statements now support `select` clauses

### Backwards incompatible changes

  * [Ecto.DateTime] `Ecto.Date`, `Ecto.Time` and `Ecto.DateTime` were previously deprecated and have now been removed
  * [Ecto.Multi] `Ecto.Multi.run/5` now receives the repo in which the transaction is executing as the first argument to functions, and the changes so far as the second argument
  * [Ecto.Schema] `:time`, `:naive_datetime` and `:utc_datetime` no longer keep microseconds information. If you want to keep microseconds, use `:time_usec`, `:naive_datetime_usec`, `:utc_datetime_usec`

### Adapter changes

  * [Ecto.Adapter] The database types `time`, `utc_datetime` and `naive_datetime` should translate to types with seconds precision while the database types `time_usec`, `utc_datetime_usec` and `naive_datetime_usec` should have microseconds precision
  * [Ecto.Adapter] The `on_conflict` argument for `insert` and `insert_all` no longer receives a `{:replace_all, list(), atom()}` tuple. Instead, it receives a `{fields :: [atom()], list(), atom()}` where `fields` is a list of atoms of the fields to be replaced
  * [Ecto.Adapter] `exclusion_constraint` will now have type `:exclusion` on the adapter metadata instead of `:exclude` (affects PostgreSQL only)
  * [Ecto.Adapter.Migration] A new `lock_for_migration/4` callback has been added. It is implemented by default by `Ecto.Adapters.SQL`
  * [Ecto.Query] Tuple expressions are now supported in queries. For example, `where: {p.foo, p.bar} > {p.bar, p.baz}` should translate to `WHERE (p.foo, p.bar) > (p.bar, p.baz)` in SQL databases. Adapters should be changed to handle `{:{}, meta, exprs}` in the query AST
